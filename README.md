# Installing

Koha's Plugin System allows for you to add additional tools and reports to Koha that are specific to your library. Plugins are installed by uploading KPZ ( Koha Plugin Zip ) packages. A KPZ file is just a zip file containing the perl files, template files, and any other files necessary to make the plugin work.

The plugin system needs to be turned on by a system administrator.

To set up the Koha plugin system you must first make some changes to your install.

* Change `<enable_plugins>0<enable_plugins>` to `<enable_plugins>1</enable_plugins>` in your koha-conf.xml file
* Confirm that the path to `<pluginsdir>` exists, is correct, and is writable by the web server
* Restart your webserver
